# Calendar Synchronization Service Planning Document

## 1. **Objective**
Synchronize room bookings between the internal booking system and Outlook (Microsoft 365) room calendars, ensuring both systems reflect the current state of all room reservations.

---

## 2. **Scope**
- Calendars involved: Outlook, booking system
- The types of events: create, update, delete, recurring events, all-day events, cancellations.
- The types of resources: rooms and equipment.
- The types of users: internal for Outlook, external and internal for the booking system.
- The types of events: meetings, appointments, etc.

---

## 3. **Direction of Synchronization**
- [X] Outlook → Booking System ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [X] Booking System → Outlook ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [X] Both directions (bi-directional) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 4. **Triggers**
### **Real-time Change Detection** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Microsoft Graph Webhooks**: Primary method for detecting Outlook changes
  - Subscribes to calendar change notifications
  - Processes events in real-time when publicly accessible webhook endpoint available
  - Automatic subscription renewal and management

### **Polling-based Fallback** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
- **Delta Query Polling**: Alternative method when webhooks unavailable
  - Uses Microsoft Graph delta queries for efficient change detection
  - Graceful fallback to full calendar sync when delta tokens unavailable
  - Configurable polling intervals (recommended: 15-30 minutes)
  - Detects both event changes and deletions

### **Outlook Deletion Detection** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Automatic Cancellation Processing**: 
  - Missing event detection via existence checks
  - Deleted Outlook events automatically cancel corresponding bookings
  - Updates booking status (`active = 0`) and appends cancellation note
  - Prevents duplicate cancellation processing
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all cancellation operations

### **Booking System Change Detection**
- Modify the booking system to emit events (e.g., via a message queue like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or even Redis) whenever a booking is created, updated, or deleted.
- The sync-service subscribes to these events and processes them in real time.
- Fallback reconciliation should run as a cron job every X minutes

### **Available Polling Endpoints** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- `POST /polling/initialize` - Initialize polling state for all room calendars
- `POST /polling/poll-changes` - Detect calendar changes and process deletions
- `POST /polling/detect-missing-events` - Find deleted events for cancellation processing
- `GET /polling/stats` - Monitor polling health and statistics

---

## 5. **Data Mapping** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Resource Mapping**: `bb_resource_outlook_item` table maps booking system resources to Outlook calendar IDs
  - Links `bb_resource.id` to Outlook calendar/room identifiers
  - Includes active status and sync metadata
  - Stores Outlook item names for reference

- **Calendar Item Mapping**: `outlook_calendar_mapping` table tracks sync relationships
  - Maps each reservation (allocation/booking/event) to Outlook events
  - Tracks sync status, timestamps, and error messages
  - Implements priority-based conflict resolution
  - Supports bidirectional sync tracking

- **Three-Level Hierarchy**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - **Event** (Priority 1): Direct bookings with specific details
  - **Booking** (Priority 2): Group-based reservations within allocations
  - **Allocation** (Priority 3): Recurring timeslots for organizations
  - All levels sync to Outlook with priority-based conflict resolution
  - Unified SQL view combines all three levels with consistent schema

- **Conflict Resolution**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Priority system (Event > Booking > Allocation)
  - Time overlap detection and resolution
  - Automatic conflict logging

- **Fields Synchronized**:
  - Title (derived from type and organization/contact info)
  - Start/End times (with timezone handling for Europe/Oslo)
  - Organizer (contact name and email)
  - Description (contextual based on reservation type)
  - Custom properties to track booking system source

- **Timezone Handling**: Europe/Oslo timezone configured for Outlook events

---

## 6. **Conflict Resolution** ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Priority-Based Resolution**: Events > Bookings > Allocations
  - Implemented in `CalendarMappingService::resolveTimeConflicts()`
  - Automatic conflict detection and resolution
  - Comprehensive logging of conflict resolution decisions

- **Time Overlap Detection**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Groups calendar items by resource and time slots
  - Identifies overlapping reservations
  - Selects highest priority item for sync

- **Conflict Scenarios**:
  - Same room booked in both systems simultaneously
  - Multiple booking system items for same time slot
  - Outlook events conflicting with booking system reservations

- **Resolution Strategy**:
  - **Booking System Authority**: Internal booking system takes precedence
  - **Priority Hierarchy**: Event > Booking > Allocation
  - **Last Modified Wins**: For same-priority conflicts (future enhancement)
  - **Manual Review**: Complex conflicts flagged for human intervention

---

## 7. **Loop Prevention** ⚠️ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

- **Custom Properties Tracking**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Events created by sync service include custom properties:
    - `BookingSystemType` (event/booking/allocation)
    - `BookingSystemId` (source system ID)
  - These properties identify sync-generated events

- **Loop Prevention Strategy** (TO BE IMPLEMENTED):
  - Check custom properties before processing Outlook webhook events

---

## 8. **Error Handling & Logging** ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

---

## 12. **Data Population Strategy** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### **Recommended Population Approach**

#### **Phase 1: Initial Setup**
1. **Ensure Resource Mapping**: First populate `bb_resource_outlook_item` table with mapping between booking system resources and Outlook calendars
2. **Initial Population**: Run bulk population method to create mapping entries for all existing calendar items:
   ```bash
   # Call the API endpoint
   curl -X POST "http://yourapi/sync/populate-mapping"
   ```

#### **Phase 2: Ongoing Population**
1. **Event-Driven Population**: When new calendar items are created in booking system, automatically create mapping entries using event handlers or triggers
2. **Sync Process Integration**: During actual sync process, update mapping table with Outlook event IDs when events are successfully created

#### **Phase 3: Maintenance**
1. **Regular Cleanup**: Run cleanup periodically to remove orphaned mappings
2. **Error Handling**: Monitor and retry failed sync items

### **Usage Examples**

```php
// Initial population
$mappingService = new CalendarMappingService($database, $logger);

// Populate all mappings
$result = $mappingService->populateMappingTable();

// Populate for specific resource
$result = $mappingService->populateMappingTable(123);

// During sync process - create mapping when syncing an item
$mappingService->createOrUpdateMapping('event', 456, 123, 'outlook-calendar-id');

// After successful Outlook event creation
$mappingService->updateMappingWithOutlookEvent('event', 456, 123, 'outlook-event-id', 'synced');

// If sync fails
$mappingService->markMappingError('event', 456, 123, 'Failed to create Outlook event');

// Get items that need to be synced
$pendingItems = $mappingService->getPendingSyncItems(50);

// Cleanup orphaned entries
$mappingService->cleanupOrphanedMappings();
```

### **API Endpoints for Population Management**
